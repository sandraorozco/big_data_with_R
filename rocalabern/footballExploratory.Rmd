## SELECT ~ select

```{r}

Exercise

* Translate from SQL to dply or from dply to SQL
```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Match
LIMIT 6
")

games %>% head()

```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT country_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n
FROM Match
GROUP BY country_id
ORDER BY n DESC
")

games %>% group_by(country_id) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% arrange(-n)

```
```{r}
countries

"select * from Country" %>% dbGetQuery(sql_con,.)
```


```{r}
games %>%
  left_join(countries, by=c("country_id" = "id")) %>%
  select(name, home_team_api_id) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(teams = n_distinct(home_team_api_id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(teams))

"SELECT name ,COUNT(DISTINCT home_team_api_id) teams 
FROM Country C, Match M 
WHERE M.country_id = C.id 
GROUP BY name 
ORDER BY  COUNT(DISTINCT home_team_api_id) " %>% dbGetQuery(sql_con,.)
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT *
FROM Player_Attributes
LIMIT 6
")

player_attribute <- tbl_df(dbGetQuery(sql_con, "SELECT * FROM Player_Attributes"))
player_attribute %>% head()

```

* From where do players with higest accuracy come from?
```{r}
player_attribute %>% arrange(-heading_accuracy) %>% select(country)
dbListTables(sql_con)
players


```

* Add team name and translate to dplyr

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sql_con, "
SELECT stage, home_team_api_id, home_team_goal
FROM Match
WHERE country_id = 1
AND season = '2008/2009'
ORDER BY stage
")
```
