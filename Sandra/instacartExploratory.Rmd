### Order products

`order_products__*.csv`

These files specify which products were purchased in each order.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM order_products__prior_tbl LIMIT 10")
```
 
## orders

`orders.csv`

This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. 


```{r}
orders_prev <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM orders_tbl LIMIT 100")

```
 
```{r}
